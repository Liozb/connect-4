# Connect-4

A classic **Connect-4** game implemented using a **client-server socket architecture**.  
This project demonstrates basic concepts of network programming and inter-process communication in a multiplayer game setup.

## Features

- ðŸŽ® Two-player Connect-4 game
- ðŸ”Œ Client-server architecture using sockets
- ðŸ’¬ Real-time interaction between players
- ðŸ§  Clear separation between game logic and network communication

## Description

The game runs with one server and two clients. The server manages the game state and relays moves between clients, while each client provides a local interface for the player to interact with the game.

This project is a great example of how traditional games can be adapted to work over a network, offering an introduction to socket programming in Python (or your language of implementation).

## Getting Started

1. Run the server script to start the game server.
2. Launch two client scripts (one for each player).
3. Follow the prompts to make moves and play the game.
